          <h2 class="headline">FedEx + Accenture: A Powerful Partnership</h2>
          <p>FedEx is a 50-year-old Fortune 100 company headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, United States. It offers a
            wide range of services in transportation, e-commerce, and business operations, supporting global trade and
            supply chain needs.</p>

          <p>With a strong culture of innovation, FedEx leverages data from every delivery to enhance tracking,
            visibility, and customer satisfaction. The company is also committed to sustainability and community
            support, constantly seeking to minimize its environmental impact while giving back to society.</p>

          <p>FedEx employs over 400,000 team members and connects 99% of the world's GDP, underscoring its massive
            influence on global logistics. The physical network‚Äîplanes, trucks, and people‚Äîbuilt over five decades has
            made FedEx one of the most impactful logistics organizations in the world.</p>

          <h3 class="subheadline">Looking to the Future</h3>
          <p>As it enters its next 50 years, FedEx is shifting focus to technology and data-driven innovation, aiming to
            "make supply chains smarter for everyone." A critical part of this transformation is its strategic
            collaboration with Accenture.</p>

          <h3 class="subheadline">Partnership with Accenture</h3>
          <p>This partnership began with strategy and consulting to help establish a new Chief Digital and Information
            Officer (CDIO) organization. It evolved into a major Managed Services contract for modernizing technology
            delivery, and has now advanced into a Journey-to-Cloud transformation program.</p>
          <p>The goal is to transition FedEx from a traditional logistics company into a technology-led enterprise, with
            enhanced productivity, faster delivery, and reduced operational costs.</p>

          <h3 class="subheadline">Scale & Impact</h3>
          <p>The seven-year Managed Services contract includes system development, enhancement, support, and
            maintenance‚Äîconsolidating services once handled by multiple vendors. Over 7,000 professionals are involved
            in this initiative, aiming to drive a 33% cost saving.</p>
          <p>Global delivery hubs in Memphis and Amsterdam, supported by centers in India and the Philippines, ensure
            worldwide coverage. This partnership marks a pivotal evolution in FedEx‚Äôs mission‚Äîredefining itself as a
            leader in both logistics and digital innovation.</p>
