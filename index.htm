          <p><strong>Accenture‚Äôs Successful Execution of USD 2.7 Billion Strategic Deal with FedEx</strong></p>
          <p>Accenture has successfully executed a landmark USD 2.7 billion deal with FedEx, demonstrating its expertise
            in large-scale workforce transformation and seamless service transition. This collaboration marks a pivotal
            step for FedEx as it advances its digital and operational capabilities, with Accenture playing a critical
            role in driving this transformation through efficient planning, rapid execution, and seamless integration.
          </p>

          <h3 class="journey-subtitle">Phase 0: Project Prometheus Execution Timeline</h3>
          <ul class="journey-list">
            <li><strong>Initial Discussions and Headcount Movement:</strong> Accenture initiated discussions and
              headcount planning with FedEx in early March 2024, setting the foundation for the successful ramp-up and
              transition phases.</li>
            <li><strong>First Ramp-Up Successfully Fulfilled:</strong> By April 1, 2024, FedEx requested an internal
              ramp-up of 400+ resources, which Accenture fulfilled within three weeks, meeting the target by April 22,
              2024.</li>
            <li><strong>Re-Badging of Eviden Atos Resources:</strong> A critical milestone was the re-badging of Eviden
              Atos resources working on the FedEx account. Despite complexities, Accenture navigated the process
              effectively, securing the agreement after six weeks. The agreement, signed in the first week of June 2024,
              included Accenture‚Äôs payment of a fee to access the Atos resources, ensuring continuity and expertise
              retention.</li>
            <li><strong>Service Transition and Cut-Over Agreement:</strong> The service transition cut-over between
              FedEx and Eviden Atos was scheduled for September 1, 2024. However, FedEx requested that all Eviden Atos
              resources be on-boarded by August 1, 2024, requiring Accenture to compress its 12-week plan into just 7
              weeks.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="journey-subtitle">Biggest Deal in ATCI History with Unprecedented Complexity</h3>
          <p>This deal stands as the largest in the history of Accenture Technology Centers in India (ATCI), involving
            the onboarding of 1200+ resources across multiple locations within an aggressive timeline of 7 weeks. The
            scale and complexity of the engagement demanded meticulous planning and flawless execution.</p>
          <ul class="journey-list">
            <li><strong>Complexity in Staffing Models:</strong>
              <ul class="journey-list-nested">
                <li><strong>Re-badging of Eviden Atos Resources:</strong> Retaining critical knowledge and domain
                  expertise by successfully transitioning 800+ resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Lateral Hiring:</strong> Quickly onboarding experienced professionals to fill specialized
                  roles and ensure continuity in FedEx‚Äôs operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Fresher Induction:</strong> Integrating fresh talent to enhance capacity and meet future
                  demands.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Seamless Integration Across Locations:</strong> Resources were onboarded across 6+ locations,
              requiring extensive coordination across recruitment, HR, and mobilization teams to ensure a smooth
              transition and operational readiness.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="journey-subtitle">Accenture‚Äôs Accelerated Execution and Operational Excellence</h3>
          <ul class="journey-list">
            <li><strong>Rapid Onboarding with Zero Disruption:</strong> Accenture successfully onboarded 1200 resources
              by August 1, 2024, ensuring seamless integration without any disruption to business operations. This
              accelerated execution was made possible through the coordinated efforts of over 100 Full-Time Equivalents
              (FTEs) across multiple teams, including HR, PTT, Recruitment, Mobilization, and Business.</li>
            <li><strong>Comprehensive Stakeholder Engagement:</strong>
              <ul class="journey-list-nested">
                <li>Conducted over 50+ live meetings and office hours to ensure alignment and clarity.</li>
                <li>Addressed and resolved 4000+ queries, demonstrating Accenture‚Äôs commitment to smooth knowledge
                  transfer and operational readiness.</li>
                <li>Successfully onboarded resources across 6+ locations, ensuring day-one productivity for all new
                  hires.</li>

          </ul>

          <h3 class="journey-subtitle">Strategic Impact and Business Transformation</h3>
          <p>This collaboration highlights Accenture‚Äôs ability to deliver large-scale, high-impact transformations with
            speed and precision. By accelerating workforce integration and ensuring zero business disruption, Accenture
            has positioned FedEx to advance its strategic goals in the logistics and technology space. The successful
